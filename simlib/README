SIMLIB/C++ is the SIMulation LIBrary for C++ programming language. You can
create models directly in C++ language using predefined simulation tools from
the library. SIMLIB allows object-oriented description of models based on
basic simulation abstractions. Current version allows a description of
continuous, discrete, combined, 2D/3D vector, and fuzzy models.

The library works with GNU C++ compiler under Linux (primary development
platform), FreeBSD, and MS Windows (all platforms on i386+ and x86_64). The
library is portable with one exception -- process switching code depends on
setjmp/longjmp and some lines of assembly language.

SIMLIB/C++ is developed at the Faculty of Information Technology, Brno
University of Technology. The development started in 1991.

How to write simulation models with SIMLIB/C++
----------------------------------------------------------------

First, see the examples -- it is easy to write simple models.

The proper way to include SIMLIB header file is
#include <simlib.h>
if SIMLIB is correctly installed
(for example in /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include).
Linker switches will be "-lsimlib -lm".

If you wish to distribute a compiled program without source code: this is
allowed.  See the LGPL license.
